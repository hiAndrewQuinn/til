This blog now has a swanky new RSS feed button right on the front page, courtesy of the well-designed [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) powering things on the backend.

Hugo newbies often don't know that Hugo usually generates these RSS feeds *automatically* for new websites. You usually have to go out of your way to turn them off. Example: [https://andrew-quinn.me/index.xml](https://andrew-quinn.me/index.xml) exists, and has existed for quite some time, without me needing to lift a finger (although I might want to put a button on my home site too!).
