They say it's always good to keep a **list of open problems** and a **list of solutions** with youw when you're doing research. Unfortunately, I didn't go into mathematics and so my solutions tend to be hopelessly non-generalizable -- but I can at least get somewhere with the first bit.

üìß: **If you have an answer to anything below, contact me!** Soon I'll add comments to this TIL site, but for now, my email can be dredged up from [andrew-quinn.me](andrew-quinn.me) or [my HN profile](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hiAndrewQuinn).

1. In VirtualBox, one can install a Guest Additions Add-On. Yet I find the stretch-to-window screen mode really drags down performance, way more than simply setting the Virtual Screen size to a fixed 1024x768 (for example) and keeping it that way. Whay is it so much more expensive for VirtualBox to dynamically resize Linux windows?
