I have a suspicion - and let me be clear, that's all this is, a suspicion,
I am taking my own claims even more lightly than usual here - that Claude Code 
makes most people's lives better, but it makes the lives of those who struggle with executive 
function *much* better.

When I have a problem to solve nowadays, I type `c`, then `Enter`. This alias opens up a fresh tmux 
window with 4 separate instances of Claude Code. Then I just... pick one and describe the problem
I'm thinking about, and hit `Enter` again. The loop begins, and suddenly I am collaborating alongside
the closest thing to an IRL *deus ex machina* I've ever seen, for the cost of a few keystrokes.

The shape of whatever we do together often takes the form of software code, but not always. Often
I use CC to just drive complex things I would want to do anyway on the computer, like figure out
which expenses last month need to be reimbursed by my employer, and then ladle on the midmarket
USD/EUR exchange rate for each, and the conversion fee if needed... Yeah, just like that, and hey,
we're dealing with management types, so maybe write this all to an Excel file... Little to the left
please... Perfect, thank you. You've been a great help, CC.

Techniques like this are the bane of task paralysis. When you commit, and commit hard, to describing
a problem as soon as it bubbles up into your awareness - even if you don't return to that specific
Claude Code thread for days, weeks, months at a time - you've already lowered the activation energy
for starting a task considerably. Moreover, in the ideal case, you are just staring at a terminal
all day long. There are no shiny baubles or that pesky URL bar beckoning you away to get distracted
by.

I would go so far as to say that, relative to the brain-breaking scope of things it can potentially 
do, Claude Code and similar AI agentic harnesses half-qualify as [calm technology](https://calmtech.com/).
Now there's a claim that will get some people mad! 

I stand by it. I can put CC away whenever I want and come
back to it whenever I'm ready. It definitely respects social norms, and I am, alas, more agreeable
than I'd like to be, and having something be unfailingly *polite* to me really does help me get the
most out of myself.
It is emphatically not "the minimum amount of technology needed to solve the problem"
... until you define "the problem" as

>I want to personally help advance civilization by extending the number of important operations which I can perform without thinking about them.

In which case, well, yeah, it probably is. You don't gotta think about much else except the problem itself in most cases.

I digress. If you struggle with executive function it's a good idea to spend a few weeks playing
around with these kinds of agentic tools. It's obviously not a replacement for Ritalin, but
you can get it without a doctor's note and that might be really important for you some day.
