*I'm kidding*, I'm switching to OpenBSD because I like security or code
quality or something.

It's totally not because the inexorable march of aging is starting to show its
effects on my ability to down necessary-evil trivia like me and my friends 
used to down forties in [the Ahhhnald](https://arboretum.harvard.edu/) after dark,
and so I'd like to settle down with a software ecosystem I can study in real
depth *once* without feeling like 20% of what I absorb in year X will be 
deprecated by year X+10.
It's got
nothing to do with the fact that my personal computing habits are basically
(1) Anki, 
(2) Firefox, 
(3) [weird little terminal sins](https://andrew-quinn.me/cli/),
and so I actually have a lot less to lose than many when it comes to recreational
computing habits. (["Dad, when do we get to the video game?" "This *is* the video game!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i_7KSBvzHU))
And it certainly isn't influenced by wanting to relive
that teenage joy-terror of hopping Linux distros and having no clue where
you are for 3 months instead of 3 days, scavenging fun out of a computing
ecosystem that's *just a little off* from what you're used to. Hey, neat,
  the soil here is [sandy loam instead of loamy sand](https://www.infohow.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Soil-Triangle.jpg). Wow, cool,
[the filesystem is weird](https://why-openbsd.rocks/fact/ffs2/). Etc.

Anyway, I'd better start reading up on [the Korn shell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74844/bash-or-kornshell-ksh/6985612#6985612). Catch you on the flip side.
