*I'm kidding*, I'm switching to OpenBSD because I like security or code
quality or something.

It's totally not because the inexorable march of aging is starting to show its
effects on my ability to down necessary-evil trivia like me and my friends 
used to down forties in [the Arnold](https://arboretum.harvard.edu/). It has
nothing to do with the fact that my personal computing habits are basically
(1) Anki, 
(2) Firefox, 
(3) [weird little terminal sins](https://andrew-quinn.me/cli/),
and so I actually have a lot less to lose than many when it comes to video
gaming habits. (["Dad, when do we get to the game?" "This *is* the game!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i_7KSBvzHU))
