Hyvää uuttaa vuottaa! As stated before, my TIL is up and running once more.

Some things I'm going to be experimenting with this year:

- Self-hosted stuff, speficially on the Raspberry Pi.
- One of those fancy new split keyboards I keep hearing everyone talk about.
- Coding more, and thinking about coding less.
