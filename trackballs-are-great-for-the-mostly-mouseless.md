I was 100% mouseless back before it was cool.
Between dropping out of high school and enrolling
in community college, I replaced my laptop with a
$80 HP EliteBook I found on eBay; when I discovered its
trackpad didn't work anyway, I went all in on a no-X
setup.
I eventually concluded that going 90% mouseless got me almost
all of the benefits, with almost none of the downsides.
It's almost as if
[returns are usually diminishing](https://stevenshang.com/things-i-learned-today-april-25-2020)! 

Yet there's one problem I still
cannot get over with using an ordinary desktop mouse:
**The desk space**. Not
only do you need 
a large amount of open desktop real estate
to work with, 
*the boundaries are fuzzy*. 
You might well
find yourself plowing your hand-rickshaw uncomfortable over an
envelope, or crashing it right into your brass candleholder,
setting your whole timber cabin ablaze. Or maybe you just
lose where the mouse is entirely from time to time, buried
under a sea of bills.

But a trackball gives you
**infinite movement for a finite homestead**. You plop the
ball in *one* place, and your arms learn to instinctually
go to that place every time you do need to take your hands
up from the keyboard. You no longer fear hemming your
pointing-device in with a wall of bills or tchotchkes.
It's always going to be right there for you, the few times
you need it.

And -- you get some much-needed insurance against future RSI
issues, which, as you might guess from the name, arise as
a result of *repetitive* movements, like using a mouse
constantly, or using a ... keyboard, constantly. An
old-fashioned pool ball style trackball simply
opens up a far wider ranger of muscular possibilities for
making basic movements with your finger-hand-arm-shoulder
effector. Oh, and the big scroll wheels which most trackballs
come with these days make reading longform texts in Firefox
much more pleasant. 

Perhaps the biggest seller for me personally is I simply 
have always found trackballs more *fun* than other input
methods I've tried. I get a little hit of joy every time
I use my palm to pan over a few windows in
[Sway](https://swaywm.org/), even though I could just as
easily do that with a few hits of `M-Left`. I don't reach
for my pointer often, and I like it when I do.
