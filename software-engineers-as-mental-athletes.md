This week I achieved a modest personal dream of mine I've had since I was a
high schooler: I purchased a proper standing desk, with a low-profile treadmill
underneath.

The total cost for a setup here in Finland came out to only about
$350, something I can easily afford with a week's take-home pay. The primary
hurdle for me was psychological: How could I justify spending so much money on
a more ergonomic setup when I'm not even sure this whole "software engineering"
thing will work out for me? Nevermind that I taught myself to program at 14 from
[a Civ 4 hacking tutorial](http://sthurlow.com/python/),
nevermind that I've been living my life as a budget cyborg for the last 15
years, nevermind that every job I've ever had post-college has been at least
60% WFH -- how could I be sure this investment in my home office will pay itself
back?

Well, by taking software engineering seriously as a profession, of course. By
treating it, and myself, the same way I've always treated it: As a game of
athletics.

Professional athletes get the big bucks for one thing and one thing only: 
Their ability to 
*win*. Be it football, distance running,
[financial modeling](https://www.theverge.com/c/24133822/microsoft-excel-spreadsheet-competition-championship),
the common through line is that these are people who *shape their lives* in such
a way that they win, consistently, and that often involves living in ways which
are substantially different to how non-athletes live their lives.
Dedicated amateur athletes operate very similarly, within the constraints of
their otherwise humdrum existence.
Your friend
who attends the local powerlifting competition might join you for a burger every
now and then, because they enjoy your company, but they're not eating burgers
*every day*, and probably not even every week.

This has a lot in common with software engineering, at least for the roundabout
way I've been involved with it for 15/29ths of my life. It's not just something
I have ever done for a paycheck - I *like* it. I like *being good* at it. I like
trying new techniques, improving my current ones, seeking ways to edge out a
faster or more featureful or less bug-prone way of doing things. 

And I have in
fact shaped my life in a lot of ways to facilitate this. I practice Leetcode
problems every day -- *for fun*. I run through
[a daily list of flashcards I only see right before I'm about to forget them](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), just so I can keep my situational awareness of things I haven't worked
with recently. (Do I need to remember how to bootstrap a Spring Boot 
application? Handle CSRF tokens in Django? Do something weird with Kubernetes
namespaces? It's all in the Anki deck.) And, of course, I try to actually 
program every
day in some capacity - sometimes just on the job, sometimes for hours in my
spare time. (In this way I'm luckier than most athletes. You probably can't play
pickup basketball *every day* after age 17 or so and expect your joints to
recover in time.)

So, why should I feel *conflicted* about spending a little bit of money to
burn more calories every day, deepen my sleep significantly, and cut my
sedentary time by a third or more when all of those things have *provably* and
*reliably* improved my own ability to program? Mental athletics and physical
athletics have a lot in common, and a little of own can vastly improve the
other.

Next on my list: Get to finally using those gymnastics rings in the cupboard.
