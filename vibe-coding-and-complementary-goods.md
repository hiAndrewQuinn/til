Peanut butter and jelly are
[complementary goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_good),
as are cars and gasoline,
newer cars and electricity,
electricity and basically everything else.

We don't normally think of, say,
Docker and Kubernetes as
complementary goods in software engineering,
because you can get both for the low price
of free. Or can you? You still have to 
invest *time* in learning both, and
as the famous saying goes...

Say it takes X hours to learn Docker
adequately. If Docker suddenly becomes
easier to learn, such that it now takes
only X / 2 hours, it's reasonable to assume
Kubernetes will become more popular in tandem, 
because one of its complements now costs
less and is hence supplied in greater
quantities anyway. You don't
want a peanut butter only sandwich, do you?

I'm a big fan of 
[vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding).
I far prefer to spend what limited time I do
allocate studying computer science to more timeless things
like
[how loop invariants work](https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/binary-search-isn-t-about-search/).

Vibe coding is sort of the ultimate destination point
of LLMs and software in general being *heavily complementary*
for the vast majority of us. In the limit case, LLMs
allow people with no programming experience at all to
create in an afternoon a tiny script or application, where
without the LLM they might have to complete a months-long
course in Python before being able to create such a prototype
with a few *weeks* of work. That's far better than X to X / 2 --
that's more on the order of X to X / 10, or even X to X / 100.

Professional software engineers are expensive.
They're expensive because the right software in the right place
can generate huge returns on investment. I suspect a paid
subscription to any common LLM these days pays itself back
handsomely as soon as your generic office worker starts to use it to
[automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
