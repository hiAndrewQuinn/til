The above 2x2 layout for Anki cards, which I call a "comprehensible
delta", is one of the best things I've happened upon in a while for
learning another language. Let's say you are learning Finnish, and you
want to say

>Lapset tykkäävät hillosta. (The kids like jam.)

First you have your "normal" Anki card, with "The kids like jam" on
the front and "Lapset tykkäävät hillosta." on the back.

Later on, you answer the card, and you get it *almost* right:

>Lapset tykkäävät hilloa. (your answer - grammatically wrong)

Rather than just hitting "Again", you can take this opportunity to make
*a brand new card* isolating this very mistake:

```
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Lapset tykkäävät hilloa.    | The kids like jam.                       |
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| (answer first)              | (answer first)                           |
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
```

and

```
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Lapset tykkäävät hilloa.    | The kids like jam.                       |
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Lapset tykkäävät HILLOSTA.  | The verb "tykätä" (to like) requires     |
|                             | the elative case (-sta/-stä) for its     |
|                             | rection. The partitive case ("hilloa")   |
|                             | is incorrect here as this is not a       |
|                             | direct object.                           |
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
```

This is exciting to me because it is the first time I have found a structure
that successfully seems to isolate one oft-problematic muscle group in the
compound movement that is active production in your L2. 

If you hate grammar, feel free to ignore this. If you later find out that
comprehensible input isn't actually all you need, and some dedicated
exercises to production might be of value, we at the "Work on things you
care about directly" camp will welcome you back with open arms.
