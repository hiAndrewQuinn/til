You've heard of comprehensible input. You may have heard of comprehensible
output. The above Anki card layout is what I call a "comprehensible delta".
It has been the latest in my experiments to rejigger a spaced
repetition system to not only help with the passive quadrants of
secondary language acquisition of reading and listening, but the *active*
quadrants of writing and speaking.

## How we got here

Say you're learning [Ithkuil](https://ithkuil.net/).

Your bog standard Anki reading practice card shows you

>Tram-mļöi hhâsmařpţuktôx.

and your job is to read it, think about it, and eventually understand the sentence as

>On the contrary, I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point.

Phenomenologically speaking, the experience of getting better and better at 
reading this card is the experince of *narrowing down*: You start with some
very rough hypotheses about what it could mean, and then as your familiarity
with the language grows, you see more and more 'sides' to the sentence at once,
eventually arriving at a place where you have more-or-less perfectly understood
the semantics of the sentence. While there are many English translations that
are possible, they all pretty much "mean" the same thing to us, at least in
isolation. Even if you gave one that looked on the surface very different 
from the back of the card, like

>Au contraire, methinks mayhaps yon sharp-fanged fells dissipate as Nyx to nicht hitherafter.

, you still know your native tongue well enough to know if what you were *trying* to say
matches what's on the back of the card semantically. Domain expertise is a beautiful
thing, ain't it.

*Writing* is a totally different beast. Say you're instead shown

>This rugged mountain range trails off at some point.

How the heck do you even *start* to guess what sentence is on the other side?
Did the author mean for you to eventually arrive at "Tram-mļöi hhâsmařpţuktôx."?
Or do they actually mean for your last train stop to be 

>Uksaršpal-lř âçt’asal.

which apparently[^1] means "This-unspecific/partitive mountain-chain/series-of-peaks rugged/uneven-surface 
trails-off/diminishes-gradually-at-some-point/place"? Or do they want

>I’spalûkšš urk’ala’s.

aka "This-manifested/perceivable mountain-chain/line-of-crests 
has-the-potential-to-terminate-at-an-unspecified-juncture"? Or maybe even

>Öl-lalûkšmarţ i’udwâ’l.

aka "To-me-it-seems-that a-linear-formation-of-rugged-peaks 
undergoes-gradual-disappearance."

Even if the entire Ithkuilian lexicon is in your active vocabulary, you face two 
problems:

1. You don't have enough *context* to really know which sentence fits the best.
2. You don't have the expertise to judge whether any alternative you give still 'works'.

You can kind of halfway get around #1 by embedding dialogues before the sentence
you want to say. 
But even then it is very rare
indeed that a dialogue wholly determines the next thing the next person talking
is going to say. There are just so many ways to do things new under the sun.

#2 appears, at first, worse. In the past, your only realistic option 
was to hire a native speaker to body check you over and over again, for several 
hours a week. For many high-resource languages, LLMs have made turned this into
something you can have on tap for perhaps a 10-20% reduction in accuracy, which
is a *mindblowing* improvement along the cost curve for all of us amateur
linguists who aren't millionaires. 

But #2 has a saving grace #1 doesn't. *Grammar*.

## Solo levelling the grammatical homunculus

Each time you try to say something new in a language, some part of your brain
has to calculate whether it is a grammatically coherent utterance. This is
neither totally deterministic, nor is it totally random; fine mostly a saying of
Anglic permutational will make your inner grammar-checking daemon say "What the
fuck, no. That's incomprehensible to anyone but you. Don't say that garbage."

You level up this homunculus in a way remarkably similar to the ways most
creatures learn most everything: You try to say something, you see whether it
worked or not, and then you try again, hopefully with a greater chance of 
success. This is very hard at first. Over time, these patterns get burned in,
they start to feel easier and easier, until they feel borderline automatic.
