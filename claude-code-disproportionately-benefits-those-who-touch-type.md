I use Claude Code. I like Claude Code. According to 
[Steve Yegge's](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04) 
[Eight-Circuit Model of Claudesciousness](http://www.timothyleary.info/8circuit.html),
I'm a pretty solid Stage 6, edging into 7 on heavy days.
I think most engineers, most of the time, can get most of
their work done faster with one of these tools than not,
although the force multiplier of that speedup is probably
not as extreme as it is in my case. Why is that?

At least one accident of history stands out to me: I can touch
type. In fact, I am a fairly proficient touch typist. 
The default 30-second session on 
[Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) 
benchmarks me as being able to type around 100 English words
per minute, with around 98% accuracy. 

In the world of competitive typists this is entry level. 
But compared to the average office worker I probably type memos
about twice as fast. From the inside it truly does feel as though
I am able to scribe marks on the digital cuneiform tablet
almost as quickly as I can imagine them. 

This doesn't matter much
much when programming by hand. But I think it turns out
to matter more than you think when barking at an agent.
Being able to give the agent twice as many words before your
own irritation hits a boiling point and you hit enter, over
and over again, probably results in solutions that are much
more targeted than baseline. 

What's more, this is probably
true *regardless* of any other techniques you do or do not
employ. For example, like most seasoned Claude Code users,
I make liberal use of the Control-G shortcut to open up a tiny
dedicated text editor for my next prompt, much like what
[Ctrl-X, Ctrl-E does in your terminal in general](https://andrew-quinn.me/ctrl-x-ctrl-e).
I also use Plan Mode religiously, even for the smallest of
changes (even better nowadays because Plan Mode can
automatically clear the conversation on each new plan).
But *even before* I did any of that people would see the way
I interacted with the system and say, "Whoa, you get really
detailed with your prompts." And when I asked them why they 
didn't give more details themselves, they usually just said
"I don't know, it gets annoying to have to think that hard."

But you're *already* thinking that hard when you use these
kinds of tools. You might as well get it on the page.
