# Today I Learned (TIL)

I learn a lot of new things every day. At some point I decided I wanted to have
a public record of some of them, so I wrote a [shell script](./til.fish) to let
me open a terminal, type `til`, and immediately jot down whatever little tidbit
I just came across. This repo is the result of that.

## Quickstart

_In case you want to make a repo like this for yourself:_

- Remove `.git/` and all of my `.md` files (except `README.md`, of course).
- Install `fish`, `git`, `kitty`, and `nvim`.
- `cp til.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/` to get the command into your shell.
- Run `til` at the Fish shell and watch the magic.
