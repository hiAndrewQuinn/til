Most languages have at least one high quality textbook written for
secondary learners of the language. (This is no guarantee that one will
be able to read the language _that_ textbook is written in, but English
to X is quite common, and some intrepid textbook writers have solved
this problem by writing the textbook in the very language it is being
taught in, starting with the simplest possible phrases and moving
gradually up in difficulty.)

However, language learning is almost entirely a self-guided process.
Even if someone chooses to attend a class or hire a tutor for the
language, the vast majority of the work has to be performed by the
student themselves, with many hours of reading, writing, speaking, and
listening. Until recently there has been no adequate feedback loop
for these top tier language textbooks outside of asking a speaker
already proficient in the language. Textbook authors know this, of
course, and for that reason great emphasis has been put on making the
flow of examples and problem statements as intuitive as possible for the
presumed-alone student.

**LLMs change this fundamentally.**
One can now easily open a language textbook, begin diligently working
through the exercises in a linear fashion, and then check their answer
with an LLM, and be confident that what comes out will be adequate for
the learning process. This makes language textbooks, with their
carefully honed examples, much more viable in the competitive meta of
language learning materials.

Obviously this is not true for every language on Earth.
You're
probably still better off finding a human tutor if only 300 people
speak the language you are studying. But most of us aren't studying
critically endangered languages. We're studying Arabic, or Norwegian,
or Spanish, or ... English! Chatting with an LLM all day in English is
a surefire way to get better English skills, which is probably the most
important category of all economically.

Nor does it have to be true that the LLM produces grammatically correct
sentences or explanations 100% of the time to be useful - nobody does,
not even teachers. I've seen LLMs whiff the finer points of Finnish
grammar many times in my acquisition process, but in no way does that
mean their whole value prop is negated.

Pick up a language textbook today and try it out. You might find
yourself surprised by how efficient your progress can be.
