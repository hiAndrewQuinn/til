One of the cooler things about working in a firm founded
and run by a lot of dyed-in-the-wool Linux hackers like
my current place is that there is *a lot* of Bash lying
around, accumulated over a good 25 years or so. For all
their faults, pure shell solutions still set the silver
standard for programs which appear almost entirely
immune to bit rot.

But you know what? *So does vanilla PHP.*
That pink stuff that was made from the ground up to get you
from zero to working dynamic web page as fast as possible.

PHP is Web Shell. I'm convinced of it now.

It sucks. Everyone you know has
moved on to bigger and better things. And everyone you don't
know, the other 80% of the Internet, is still using it
to get things done, cheaply, reliably, and without
fanfare, but with a lot of service contracts, because
see the beginning of this paragraph.
